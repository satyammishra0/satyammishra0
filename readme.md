# A brief intro about me 
Hello, I am Satyam mishra. I am an explorer, enthusiast and a self taught web developer. I am currently pursuing my BCA from VSICS saket nagar Kanpur is affiliated with CSJMU along with my BCA. I have also served as an intern and a freelance web developer for a digital marketing company. With hands-on experience of 1 year in web development I have focused on giving fast, secure, SEO friendly and completely responsive websites to the clients using the technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, PHP, SQL, Figma and Github. The greatest pleasure for me while working with them was the client satisfaction and giving the client the best and above his expectations. One more factor which I always focus on is a well documented code with proper explanation . 
The motivation factor for me while working is the client’s happiness, giving my best to him. 
Other than coding I love watching movies and volleyball.
